# Skin-Checker

I designed a program that asks the user a series of questions about their skin type (e.g., sensitivity to the sun, tendency to burn or tan).
Based on their answers, I classified their skin type (e.g., oily, dry, normal).
(This is a personal project, the code might be updated to include Object Oriented Programming methods)
